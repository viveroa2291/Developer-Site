My learning was focused on making a simple UI with a smooth UX added with a music theme for the page. I don't have links in place but scrolling down will lead to a different page. 

# Optimizations

To improve this site, I plan to cleaning up the design and making the UX more smooth. By doing that I want to do better alignment with the tech stack, find a better color pallet for the site and adding more information.
